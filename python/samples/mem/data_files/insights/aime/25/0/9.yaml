insight: "Let the three rows be numbered 1,2,3 and the nine symbols be 1,…,9.  Fix row 1 once and for all to be the identity 1 2 … 9;  its three 3‐blocks are then X={1,2,3}, Y={4,5,6}, Z={7,8,9}.  

1)  In block i (i=1,2,3) row 2 must choose a 3‐subset Bᵢ² disjoint from the corresponding row 1 block (so B₁²⊂Y∪Z, B₂²⊂X∪Z, B₃²⊂X∪Y), and these three 3‐sets must themselves be pairwise disjoint.  One shows by a small inclusion–exclusion or multivariate count that there are exactly  
   T=∑_{k=0}^3 (3 choose k)³ =1+27+27+1=56  
   ways to pick (B₁²,B₂²,B₃²).  

2)  Once the three 3‐sets in each row are chosen, one still has to place them into the 3 columns of each block;  each 3‐set admits 3! orderings, so row 2 contributes (3!)³ placements, and row 3 (whose blocks are forced to be the complements) another (3!)³.  Hence, with row 1 fixed, the total is  
   56·(3!)⁶ =56·6⁶ =56·46 656 =2 612 736.  

3)  Finally row 1 itself could have been any of 9! permutations, so the grand total is  
   N = 9!·56·(3!)⁶  
     =362 880·2 612 736  
     =948 109 639 680.  

Its prime factorization is  
   N =2¹⁶·3¹⁰·5¹·7².  
Thus p=2,a=16; q=3,b=10; r=5,c=1; s=7,d=2, and  
   p·a + q·b + r·c + s·d =2·16 +3·10 +5·1 +7·2 =32+30+5+14 =81."
